A Minecraft Server Plugin for 1.20.4 adding a claim system with an innovative GUI

## Features
- Players can create their own team (and invite others) or join an existing one after getting an invite
- Each team can claim chunks on the map to protect their land from other players
  - The amount of chunks each team can claim is calculated by a default value (setting ´teams.chunksDefault´) plus an additional amount per team member (setting ´teams.chunksPerPlayer´)
- Adds an interactive map item with a GUI, allowing the player to
  - see the chunks and claims around them from a top-down perspective (LIVE)
  - claim and unclaim chunks for their team by simply left-clicking the desired area
  - manage their team in a special team settings section
  - recieve team invites if not yet added to a team
